Task #1 - determining whether or not a 3d object collides

About file:
	This file currently loads the coordinates of a test file into the program. The file will print out the coordinates of b1, and b2 and whether or not they collide. With the test file it should print out false, false, true, false

    You can uncomment the for testing purposes lines 29 - 34 to see the program work step by step. If you want to insert your own coordinates you can comment out lines 51 - 59 and uncomment lines 62 and 63



Functions:
    
def ball_collide(b1,b2):
    """ This function will determine whether or not the balls collide

        Args:
          b1 - tuple holding stats of ball 1
          b2 - tuple holding stats of ball 2

        Returns:
            boolean saying whether or not the balls are colliding

Task #2 - rock, paper, scissors game

About File:
	This file is ran inside a while loop that will only exit once a user inserts 'q' or 'Q'. It is a basic game of rock paper scissors against the CPU. The CPU answer is generated by a random number and both are then passed into the function. While lines 73 - 88 could be done more proficiently this was the easiest way for bugs to be found while programming.

Functions:

def eval_winner(p1, p2):
    """Determines the winner between two players of rock, paper, scissors

        Args:
            p1 - the first player's choice of R, P, or S
            p2 - the second player's choice or R, P, or S

        Returns:
            1 - if player 1 wins
            2 - if player 2 / CPU wins
            0 - if the game results in a tie
    """
